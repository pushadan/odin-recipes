        Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul> 
        <li>Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li>Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
        </li>
