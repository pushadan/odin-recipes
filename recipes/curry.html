    <p>
      Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes.<br>
      The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles.<br>
      This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).
